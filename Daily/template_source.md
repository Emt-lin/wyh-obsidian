my A+ problem today


B+

company admin/must dos (do ~1 per day at min. whatevet you're feeling)

personal life (do ~2 per day at min)


Here's how I plan my day. 
My goal -- don't drown in nonsense. 
Each day, I only have one primary "todo". 
If I don't do this one thing then to me the day was a massive big fat fucking flop. 
It's my A+ problem. 
The A+ is the only thing I focus on doing and my whole day usually revolves around it.
I spend 20-30m just figuring the A+ out, usually the night before -- sometimes it's obvious, sometimes it's not.
I journal every night about the day and usually afterwords, what I need to do the next day becomes clear.
Once I have it, I break down the A+ into a little step-by-step attack plan to just keep myself organized. 
Then, I write down my B+ problems.
Stuff that's important but not really my A+. 
I always get to B+ problems only if I finish the A+. 
Lastly there are just some "must dos" like company admin stuff + life admin stuff. This is usually the simple stuff that gives me the most anxiety/stress (ex. email, a bill to pay, a doctors appointment, etc) 
So, I write them all down and just attack them by doing ~1-2 per day. 
This system works for me! Hope it helps someone out there tryna figure one out for themselves.
